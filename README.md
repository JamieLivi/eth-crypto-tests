Suite of tests to demonstrate that the outcomes of these functions are identical to those of [eth-crypto](https://github.com/pubkey/eth-crypto), but written in pureJS without any dependencies on node / browser objects so that they can be used anywhere, including on mobile üì± without any polyfilling üòÅ:

- `createIdentity`
- `decryptWithPrivateKey`
- `encryptWithPublicKey`
- `keccak256` (Solidity packed, see [these docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.14/abi-spec.html#non-standard-packed-mode) for more info)
- `publicKeyByPrivateKey`
- `recoverPublicKey`
- `sign` (using secp256k1 elliptic curve)

## Outcomes

### Resources

Mainly uses the [ethereum-cryptography](https://github.com/ethereum/js-ethereum-cryptography) library, which is implemented with 6 [noble & scure](https://paulmillr.com/noble/) dependencies - so basically under the hood we are mainly using:

- [noble-curves](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-curves)
- [noble-hashes](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-hashes)
- [noble-ciphers](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-ciphers)
